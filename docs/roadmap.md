## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock ROS2 dependencies where needed
- Achieve >80% code coverage

### Integration Testing
- Test interactions with real ROS2 system

- Safety and security verification

## Development Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Each phase should produce a working, testable system
2. **Backward Compatibility**: New features should not break existing functionality
3. **Safety First**: All vehicle control operations must have safety checks
4. **Performance Awareness**: Monitor and optimize resource usage continuously
5. **Documentation**: Keep documentation updated with each phase

## Success Metrics

- **Phase 1-2**: Basic functionality operational within 2 weeks
- **Phase 3-4**: Core Autoware integration complete within 1 month
- **Phase 5-6**: Advanced features operational within 2 months
- **Phase 7-8**: Production ready within 3 months

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- ROS2 version compatibility issues
- Autoware API changes
- Performance bottlenecks with data streaming

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain compatibility with multiple ROS2 versions
- Abstract Autoware interfaces for flexibility
- Implement adaptive data sampling and compression

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- ROS2 (Humble/Iron)
- Autoware.Universe
- Python 3.10+
- FastMCP framework

### Development Tools
- Rye for Python environment management
- ROS2 development tools
- Autoware simulation environment
- Testing frameworks (pytest, ros2test)

## Review and Feedback

Each phase completion should include:
1. Code review
2. Testing verification
3. Documentation update
4. Performance assessment
5. Stakeholder feedback

## Next Steps
